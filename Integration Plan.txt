Things to work on:

Integrating GUI & Image Processing:
- Create GUI to display final results (either image or gif) and data to the user
- Create a gif from a series of images
- Capture and crop stellarium images given a time interval & selection coordinates from the GUI
- Overlay heat map with cropped stellarium image

Integrating Signal Processing & Antenna:
- Get Airspy Mini repaired
- Run script from Raspberry Pi
- Clean up signal data
	- Look into wavelet denoising through python
- Take a scan with the LNA and SDR without an antenna attached, subtract this scan from all other scans taken with the telescope

Integrating Route Planning & Motorized Mount:
- Add earth's rotation function given a time interval

Motorized Mount:


Image Processing:
- whole skymap image with heatmap 
- function to take skymap images every time interval
- make a mask to make the final image overlay a circle

GUI:
- show final image / gif to the user along with a legend for the heatmap
